# vw-scale-calculator

`vw-scale-calculator` is a React hook designed to dynamically scale components based on the viewport width. It allows you to create responsive and adaptable user interfaces that automatically adjust their scale as the window size changes.

## Installation

To get started with `vw-scale-calculator`, you need to install it from npm. You can do this using either npm or Yarn:

```bash
npm install vw-scale-calculator
```

or

```bash
yarn add vw-scale-calculator
```

## Usage

### Importing the Hook

First, import the `useViewportScale` hook into your React component:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import useViewportScale from 'vw-scale-calculator';
```

### Defining Reference Points

Create an array of reference points that define how the scale should change based on viewport width. Each reference point is an object with a `width` and a corresponding `scale` value.

```tsx
const referencePoints = [
  { width: 1263, scale: 0.6 },
  { width: 1519, scale: 0.66 },
  { width: 1903, scale: 0.72 },
];
```

### Using the Hook in a Component

Use the `useViewportScale` hook in your component, passing the reference points array as an argument. The hook returns the current scale value, which you can then use to adjust the style or layout of your component.

```tsx
const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
  // Get the current scale based on the viewport width
  const scale = useViewportScale(referencePoints);

  return (
    <div style={{ transform: `scale(${scale})`, border: '1px solid black', padding: '20px' }}>
      This content scales with the viewport width.
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

### Example

Hereâ€™s a complete example that demonstrates how to use `useViewportScale`:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import useViewportScale from 'vw-scale-calculator';

// Define the reference points
const referencePoints = [
  { width: 1263, scale: 0.6 },
  { width: 1519, scale: 0.66 },
  { width: 1903, scale: 0.72 },
];

const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
  // Calculate the scale based on the viewport width
  const scale = useViewportScale(referencePoints);

  return (
    <div style={{ transform: `scale(${scale})`, border: '1px solid black', padding: '20px' }}>
      This content scales with the viewport width.
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

## API

### `useViewportScale(referencePoints: ReferencePoint[])`

- **Parameters**
  - `referencePoints`: An array of objects where each object contains:
    - `width`: The viewport width at which the scale changes (number).
    - `scale`: The scale value corresponding to the viewport width (number).

- **Returns**
  - The calculated scale value based on the current viewport width (number).
